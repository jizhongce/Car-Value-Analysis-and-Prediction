The goal of project is to analyze the price of 2005 used General Motors(GM) cars with different features to build a best model to make prediction of the car values of 2005 used General Motors(GM). In the project, we use SAS to analyze the data and use different methods such as check Q-Q plot, residual plot and so on to do the multiple linear regression and simple linear regression to find the pattern between dependent variable and independent variables. In addition, we use Adjested R-Square value, C(p) value, AIC(p) value and SBC(p) value to do the best model selection.
